.. note::
   ALIAS is still a work in progress and should not be used in any
   professional or academic setting in its current state.

ALIAS (Anomalous Lines In Apogee Spectra) is a tool to detect and characterize
unusual emission lines in APOGEE spectra. ALIAS is 

Lasers serve as a highly efficient method of communication over interstellar
distances due to their highly directional nature, and thus extraterrestrial
intelligence could use such technology to communicate with us or each other.
Such technologies would appear as narrow emission features that would be
detectible from Earth.

There have been several analyses of existing data in search of such signatures,
such as [ZUCK2023], using the Automated Planet Finder, as well as [TELL2015]
and [TELL2017], using HIRES. Both of these operated at optical wavelengths,
however, such signatures could also occur at near infrared wavelengths. The
purpose of ALIAS is to attempt to detect such signatures within the
near-infrared spectra provided by APOGEE.

APOGEE is a high-resolution near-infrared spectrograph operated by the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, and was used primarily to map out the composition of the
galaxy by surveying giant stars across all regions of the Milky Way. As part of
this, many other stars, including a large number of main sequence stars, were also
surveyed. These stars could potentially host extraterrestrial intelligence.

This work is conducted as part of the `Breakthrough Listen Summer Undergraduate
Research Internship`_ at the Berkeley SETI Research Center, funded by the 
National Science Foundation and `Breakthrough Initiatives`_.
