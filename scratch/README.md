# Scratchwork

This folder serves as a place for intermediate experimentation with algorithms.
Some of these will eventually end up in the main module. The notebooks are
numbered in logical order.

Here is a quick summary of what the notebooks in this folder contain:

- `01_target_selection.ipynb`: Demontration of the target selection used to obtain the initial dataset.
- `02_plotting_spectra.ipynb`: Experiments with plotting spectra to understand their structure.
- `03_continuum_normalize.ipynb`: A notebook implementing the continuum normalization algorithm used by ALIAS.
- `04_injection_test.ipynb`: A demonstration of the methods used to perform injection testing.
- `05_pixel_masking`: A demonstration of how the pixels are masked to exclude common problem pixels.
- `06_improved_retrieval`: Code to quantify the candidate emission lines.
- `07_widths`: Code to retrieve the widths of the lines.
- `08_categorize`: A demonstration of how manual categorization is done.
